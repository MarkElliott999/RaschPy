*** RaschPy Examples ***

In this folder, there are the following examples:

- Worked examples for the following models: SLM, PCM, RSM, global MFRM, matrix MFRM
- Code to run the RaschPy anaysis for the simulation studies in Elliott & Buttery
  (2022a) and Elliott & Buttery (2022b)
- An Excel spreadsheet working through the PAIR algoritm for dichotomous data
  to illustrate how it works

*** Worked examples  ***

For each class, there is a Jupyter notebook which runs through the main analysis
functions from a simulated data set (also included). .csv files with the generating
parameters for the simulations are included for reference and comparison, and a folder
of output files contains the .csv files of statistcal output and .png files of graphical
output.

*** Code to run the simulation studies analysis ***
*** NOTE: Code for extended MFRM simulation analysis not yet in repo ***

Jupyter notebooks to run large-scale simulation experiments as in Elliott & Buttery (2022a)
and Elliott & Buttery (2022b) are included (this only covers the RaschPy analysis - running
comparisons with JMLE, CMLE or any other algorithms would need to be done separately, with
appropriate software (data sets and generating parameters are saved to file for comparison
with other algorithms).

In order to run the experiment in Elliott & Buttery (2022a), it is necessary to install an
additional Python packege, raschpy_addendum, which contains the code to calculate RSM
thresholds using the EVM method (Garner & Engelhard, 2002) and the modified EVM method
described in Elliott & Buttery (2022a). The raschpy_addendum package may be found in its
own folder in this directory.

*** Excel spreadsheet ***

An Excel file modelled on Moulton's worked example of JMLE is included, showing the steps
of the PAIR algorithm for dichotomous data. The data set is the same as the Moulton data set,
and the Moulton JMLE results are included for comparison.
